# Chatbot Cool Moody
It can be difficult for some people to express their feelings or they might not be very aware of their own feelings. This project aims to create a chatbot that can be used to administer a self-reported assessment for psychological,and help you by suggesting tips and technologies.  

# Install Packages
Before starting to work on our chatbot we need to download a few python packages.
We will simply use pip to install the following:
- numpy
- nltk
- pytorch

# Training Data
Now it's time to understand what kind of data we will need to provide our chatbot with. Since this is a simple chatbot we don't need to download any massive datasets. We will just use data that we write ourselves.we will need to create a .JSON file that contains the same format as the one seen below. I've called my file "pairs.json".
